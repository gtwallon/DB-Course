# Tableau Work Samples
Provided are screenshots of two dashboards that I am in progress of completing as practice working in Tableau. 
- The data warehouse dashboard (DW_db_ss1-2) shows an analysis of the business's profits by geography and product category. 
  - This dashboard could be used by the management team at the company to better understand which domains of their business (product category) are performing better in different locations. They could filter by product category and by geographic location to see the corresponding details.

- The Spotify dashboard (spotify_db_ss1-4) shows information about the top artists and songs of 2023, measured by total streams.
  - This dashboard could be used by people trying to identify trends in the music industry, i.e., qualities of the songs with the largest number of streams.
  - Another potential use case for the dashboard, in particular page 4 (spotify_db_ss4) could be for a musician that a company employs for the purpose of creating an original song for a new marketing campaign. For example, say Nike employs a musician to make them an original song, and they want the song to have high energy and medium level valence (mood). The musician could use the dashboard to find the most popular songs that fit these criteria, identify useful details about these songs (artist, Bpm, Key), and derive inspiration for their creation.
