# Tableau Work Samples
Provided are screenshots of two dashboards that I am in progress of completing as practice working in Tableau. 
- The Spotify dashboard (spotify_db_ss1-3) shows information about the top artists and songs of 2023, measured by total streams.
- The data warehouse dashboard (DW_db_ss1-2) shows an analysis of the business's profits by geography and product category.
