# Database Course Work Samples

These MySQL Workbench files and Word documents are samples of homework assignments I completed for my Design and Analysis of Database Systems course.   

- In "hw4.sql" I answer business intelligence questions by querying a database.
- In "hw5.sql"
- The files "HW-4 SQL.sql" and "HW-5 DW.sql" were provided to us by the instructor.   
- "Database HW6 MongoDB" was an assignment I completed where I queried a MongoDB database.
