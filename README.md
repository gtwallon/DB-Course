# Database Course Work Samples

These MySQL Workbench files and Word documents are samples of homework assignments I completed for my Design and Analysis of Database Systems course.   

- In "hw4.sql" I answer business intelligence questions by querying a relational database using JOIN and GROUPBY functions.
- In "hw5.sql" I answer business intelligence questions by querying a data warehouse.
- The files "HW-4 SQL.sql" and "HW-5 DW.sql" were provided to us by the instructor.   
- "Database HW6 MongoDB" was an assignment I completed where I queried a MongoDB database.

### Tableau Folder  
Contains a couple work-in-progress Tableau Dashboards 

Provided are screenshots of two dashboards that I am in progress of completing as practice working in Tableau. The Spotify dashboard shows information about the top artists and songs of 2023, measured by total streams. The data warehouse (DW) dashboard shows an analysis of the business's profits by geography and product category.
